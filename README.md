# TagWise: Future of Container Tracking


TagWise is a cutting-edge container tracking system designed to revolutionize operations within Container Freight Stations (CFSs). By leveraging RFID technology, TagWise dynamically subdivides CFS plots into smaller subplots, each monitored by RFID readers with a 100-meter range. This system provides real-time, approximate location data for containers, enhancing efficiency and reducing delays.
